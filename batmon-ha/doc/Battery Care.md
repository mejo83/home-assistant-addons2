* LFP aging has not been fully understood
* Calendar aging is significant
* why are you buzing a battery?
  * the bigger the better?
* start small! its easy to add another pack in parallel (same chemistry)
* it can be also handy to have a big and a small bat in parallel. you can use the big pack only when needed.
  and you can carry the small pack around.
* the worst usage of batteries is not using them
* think of batteries a precious, limited resource.
* temperature matters a lot. keep the batteries cools
  * keep inverters and other heat sources away
  * make sure bus bars are properly connected and dont get hot.
  * no direct sun light
* stay awaz from random aliexpress suppliers. this is like playing in a casino.
  there are suppliers that sometimes ship good batteries, and when they run out of stock,
  they ship a lower grade without further notice.
