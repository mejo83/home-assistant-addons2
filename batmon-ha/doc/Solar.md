* Solar cells resistance has a positive temperature coefficient
* This means that higher temperatures means lower power output
* This is why Wp can barely reached in summer
* Vertically mounted panels have a much better cooling

* With vertical mount we can flatten the power curve during the day
* Lower temperatures means longer lifespan
* Vertical Bi-Facial panels
* Vertical panels can collect dew from the air
